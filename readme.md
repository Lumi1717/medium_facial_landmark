# Face Detection with Mediapipe

This project demonstrates how to use Mediapipe for facial landmark detection. The script processes an image to detect facial landmarks and marks them on the image.

## Files

- `main.py`: The main script that performs facial landmark detection.
- `tom-hanks-niece.jpg`: The input image used for facial landmark detection.
- `output_image.png`: The output image with facial landmarks marked.
- `readme.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

3. The script will display the image with facial landmarks marked and save it as [output_image.png](http://_vscodecontentref_/1).
